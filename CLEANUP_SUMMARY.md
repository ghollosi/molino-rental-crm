# Cleanup Summary - Molino Rental CRM

**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Action**: Organized duplicate files

## ✅ What was cleaned up:

### 1. **Removed duplicate app directory**
- ❌ Deleted: `/src/app/` (old version)
- ✅ Kept: `/app/` (active version with PWA, settings, etc.)

### 2. **Moved log files**
- 📁 Moved to backup: All `.log` files
- These were temporary development logs

### 3. **Organized configuration files**
- ❌ Removed: `postcss.config.js` (old format)
- ✅ Kept: `postcss.config.mjs` (current format)

### 4. **Archived old documentation**
- 📁 Moved to backup: Old SESSION_LOG and CHECKPOINT files
- ✅ Kept: Current PROGRESS.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md

### 5. **Component cleanup**
- ❌ Removed: `dashboard-stats.tsx` (basic version)
- ✅ Kept: `enhanced-dashboard-stats.tsx` (feature-rich version)

## 📁 Backup location:
All removed files are safely stored in: `/backup-duplicates/`

## 🚀 Project is now cleaner with:
- Single app directory (`/app/`)
- No duplicate configurations
- Clear component versions
- Organized documentation

## 💡 Recommendations:
1. The `/backup-duplicates/` folder can be deleted after 1-2 weeks if no issues arise
2. Consider adding `/backup-duplicates/` to `.gitignore`
3. Regular cleanup of log files can be automated

The project structure is now more maintainable and less confusing!
